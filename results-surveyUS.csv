Those greenhouses allow food to be grown with half (possibly less) the water soil farming uses, on land that isn't regularly viable farmland, year-round, thus allowing them to provide a significant amount of food to the entire EU throughout the year without problems. That, plus the fact that all the houses being white and so closely placed together in such a large area acts as a giant reflector actually resulting in lower temperatures in the surrounding areas on average by several degrees every year since it's been constructed.

While  I believe that most ""grass roots"" people involved in the movement are well-intentioned and genuinely concerned, I feel they are useful idiots acting on behalf of people with nefarious intentions who use ""the climate"" as a means to achieve unrelated objectives.  Carbon Dioxide is essential to our fragile ecosystem. Plant life is reliant on CO2, and would, in fact, wither away and die without it. The reason CO2 has been made into a boogeyman, along with things like Methane, is because they are byproducts of things that the environmentalists oppose, namely burning of fossil fuels and the consumption of meat.  I think it is irresponsible to scare people with hysterical projections about an upcoming climate calamity that has no basis in reality.
